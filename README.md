MASLAB 2018

Team Ball-E-Wood

Publishing the code from team 1's private repo.

This repo has the notebooks we used for testing out computer vision and deep learning models in `notebooks/`.

In `python/` there is the ROS code that runs on the robot. It has modules for the brain, driver, goal-driver, and vision of the robot.
